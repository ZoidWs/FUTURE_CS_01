TASK 1 - WEB APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING.

This is the Web Application Security Testing report that I produced during my time as an cybersecurity intern for Future interns.

Using tools like OWASP ZAP Proxy, I tested for vulnerabilities, mapped them against the OWASP Top 10 threat list, and documented findings in a professional-style report.

I tested all of this on a open source web application called bWAPP.

very cool yes.
